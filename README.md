# Setup

First let's install Node.js (npm will be installed as well):

```
brew install node
```

Then let's install TypeScript (`-g` flag will install the package globally):

```
npm install -g typescript
```

# Run

```
npm install
```

```
npm run build
```

```
npm run start
```

# Test

```
curl "localhost:8080/route?from=...&to=..."
```

# Betterments

* Consider using pnpm, that is faster than yarn, that is faster than npm
